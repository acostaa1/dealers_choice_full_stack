# dealers_choice_full_stack
<!-- 
x name your database dealers_choice_full_stack
x build your backend with express, pg, sequelize
be creative
build your front end with react, redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, react-router-dom@5, axios and whatever other libraries you might need
make sure to seed your data models so that you can display data on the front-end
allow user to modify backend database via post, delete, and optionally put requests
your application should enable a user to see a list of items, a detail of that item based on a different url, as well as the ability to insert a new item and delete an item.
use this file structure to start out:
    server.js
    src/index.js
    index.html -->

<!-- 
x build a simple Sequelize model and seed some data when the express application starts
build an express api GET route which can be used by the client to return data from your model
build out your front end slowly using redux, react-redux, redux-thunk. You can keep things in one file and separate things out as you get things working.
when you are able to show the back end data on the front end, then you should move on
using react-router-dom add a client side route which shows a single item.
add an api POST route on your server which will insert data (you can use faker to make things simpler and you can test this with curl)
add the ability to create data in your react application using a form
add an api DELETE route on your server which can be used to delete data
add the ability to destroy data in your react application
deploy
BONUS add an api PUT route on your server which can be used to update data
BONUS add the ability to update data in your react application (for simplicity this might be a boolean property on your model)
BONUS as you get things working, you can refactor- or add functionality or even another model
BONUS you might decide you want to add some links for filtering data based on the url -->
